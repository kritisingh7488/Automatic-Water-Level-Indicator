# Automatic-Water-Level-Indicator
This project is designed using Arduino uno and water sensor to indicate water level in tank.
Components: Ardiuno uno,Water sensor, LED(3), Buzzer, Breadboard, Connecting wires, Motor, Battery, Resistor(220ohm), Relay module.
The circuit is designed to indicate three levels of water stored in the tank: empty, half and full but not overflowing. When there is no water in the tank, the red LED will glow. As the water level continues to rise and reaches half the tank, Yellow LED will glow. When the water in the tank rises to full green LED will glow, an alarm is made by the buzzer as an indication that the tank is full and the motor will be automatically off.
